# <em>Untitled</em>, 2017
<strong><em> Video Projector, Kinect Motion Sensor</em></strong>


<em>Untitled</em> is an interactive digital art installation I created for my Spring 2017 <em>Advanced Projects in Studio Art</em> (ARTS 375) class at Colgate University. The piece makes use of a  Kinect to capture the center of masses of any objects moving in and across the installation space and feeds this data to a Processing sketch projected onto a wall by an overhead projector.

In its current state, the sketch runs only on Windows. Iâ€™m working on creating a Linux version.

### Inspiration
 - Dreamcatcher by oggy: https://www.openprocessing.org/sketch/169537

### Requirements:

 - Processing 2.0: https://processing.org/download/
 - SimpleOpenNI: https://code.google.com/archive/p/simple-openni/wikis/Installation.wiki
 - OpenNI: https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI
 - Microsoft Kinect SDK v1.7: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=36996

Based on my experimentation, later versions of the above software do not work well together.
### Future Updates:
 - A p5.js version that runs online
 - A version that works with the new OpenNI2
